\usage{

  myData,
  id = "Prolific_ID",
  ready = "Ready",
  duration = "Duration..in.seconds.",
  consent = "Consent",
  progress = "Progress",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{myData}{A data frame containing participant data.}

\item{id}{A character string specifying the column name that holds unique participant IDs. Defaults to "Prolific_ID".}

\item{ready}{A character string specifying the column name that indicates readiness. Defaults to "Ready".}

\item{duration}{A character string specifying the column name for the duration in seconds. Defaults to "Duration..in.seconds.".}

\item{consent}{A character string specifying the column name for participant consent. Defaults to "Consent".}

\item{progress}{A character string specifying the column name for progress. Defaults to "Progress".}

\item{consecutively}{A character string specifying the column name for consecutive completions. Defaults to "Consecutively".}

\item{disturbance}{A character string specifying the column name for disturbance status. Defaults to "Disturbance".}

\item{quality_check}{A character string specifying the column name for quality check status. Defaults to "Quality_check".}

\item{age}{A character string specifying the column name for participant age. Defaults to "Age".}

\item{ageRange}{A numeric vector of length two specifying the valid age range. Defaults to \code{c(18, 80)}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{filtered_data}: The filtered data frame after applying all exclusion criteria.
\item \code{summary_table}: A summary table containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{Participant_ID}: IDs of participants who failed at least one criterion.
\item \code{Failed_Conditions_Count}: Number of conditions each participant failed.
\item \code{Failed_Conditions}: A comma-separated list of criteria failed by each participant.
}
}
}
\description{
This function filters participants from a dataset based on various exclusion criteria, including readiness, duration, consent, progress, and more.
It tracks participants who fail each criterion, summarizes their failures, and removes them step by step from the dataset.
}
\details{
The function applies a series of exclusion criteria to the dataset:
\itemize{
\item Participants with missing or empty IDs are removed.
\item Readiness: Participants with \code{Ready} not equal to 1 are removed.
\item Duration: Participants with duration 0, exceeding a timeout value (2640 seconds), or exceeding the mean duration plus three standard deviations are removed.
\item Consent: Participants with \code{Consent} not equal to 1 are removed.
\item Progress: Participants with \code{Progress} not equal to 100 are removed.
\item Consecutiveness: Participants with \code{Consecutively} not equal to 2 are removed.
\item Disturbance: Participants with \code{Disturbance} not equal to 1 are removed.
\item Quality Check: Participants with \code{Quality_check} not equal to 1 are removed.
\item Age: Participants outside the specified \code{ageRange} are removed.
